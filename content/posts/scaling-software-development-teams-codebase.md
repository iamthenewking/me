This was a talk I gave in a few conferences in 2019. For now, I'm gonna share the slides and the video, but at some point I might turn it into a written article if I think it's worth it (let me know if that's something you'd be interested in reading).

### Talk Description

If you are an engineer, you're familiar with the process to start building a software product: setup your development environment, write some code, commit and push changes to your repository, and deploy your application, simple like that. Simple if you are working alone, on a small personal project. When the development team and the system start to grow, things need to change to be able to scale efficiently.

This talk is about the challenges of scaling software development, multiplying team size and system complexity, and some strategies to deal with them. Including but not limited to: team sizes, system design & code organization, quality assurance and automation/DevOps.

### Why this talk?

The internet is full of resources on how to learn how to code or build your first web page or mobile app. But the transition from a small personal app to a fully-scalable software product, with practices that modern tech companies are using is something not a lot of people talk about. Yet, this is a very important topic that everyone involved in a product development life cycle (engineers, PMs, QA, etc) should understand in order to take their product, organization and careers to the next level.

This talk intends to clarify this transition and expose some of the common problems organizations go through when scaling their software development process and how modern tech companies are solving them.

### Video

I presented this talk in a few different conferences, the video below is from Women Who Code CONNECT Asia, that happened in Singapore on August 31st, 2019.
