Back in 2018 I became a Director of [Women Who Code Tokyo](https://womenwhocode.com/tokyo). I had already been a volunteer and a mentor for the study sessions, but then I decided to help organizing my first event.

Since there were many people in the study sessions who were learning how to code for the first time, either students graduating from university or professional women considering a career change, we decided to organize the event with the theme ["How Do You Start A Career In Tech?"](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Tokyo/events/253653211/).

We gathered our own leaders ([Kate Gamo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kategamo/), [Lena Morita](https://twitter.com/mirka) and myself), partnered with a local coding bootcamp here in Tokyo ([Code Chrysalis](https://www.codechrysalis.io/)) and also got their CTO, [Yan Fan](https://twitter.com/yanarchy), to put together short talks about how to get started with tech and programming. My talk was basically about all the things you can do with programming and how to choose what to learn first if you want to become a software engineer.

Fast forward to this week, I was browsing Twitter when I saw this thread and it instantly reminded me of my talk, so I decided to reply to it.

After that first presentation on our Women Who Code event, I actually went back to my slides a few times to tweak them here and there, and I ended up using this deck to share with people (or present it for small groups) whenever anyone asked me"Where do I start if I want to learn programming / become a software engineer?".

So here it is, the latest version of my slides on *"Where Do I Start? An introduction to Software Development from the very beginning"*.

I hope this is helpful. Please share if it is :)

Also, if you are curious about the Women Who Code event I mentioned above, here are the videos for all the talks we had that day, including mine (with the early version of the slides above, a lot has changed since that lol):
